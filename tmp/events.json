   "Description": "This UC Berkeley Library exhibit explores the themes of the documentary Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution, which is the featured work of this year’s On the Same Page program. The film traces the genesis of the Disability Rights Movement from Camp Jened, a camp for teenagers with disabilities in upstate New York, to UC Berkeley, and then to San Francisco for the 504 sit-in, the longest sit-in at a federal building to date. This fascinating story is richly illustrated by primary sources from Library collections, including photographs, memoirs, oral histories, newsletters, and publications by allies such as the Black Panthers.",

In the first moments of dialogue (“Meet me at the house at Palos Verdes”), the setting is revealed to be Los Angeles. Criss Cross is taut, exciting, extremely well-written, and one of the best of the sleazy underworld films of the 1940s, the closest Robert Siodmak came to capturing the essence of Fritz Lang.",

   "Description": "I will introduce the class of operator-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebras, which are second quantization von Neumann algebras built on certain Hilbert bimodules over a base von Neumann algebra. When the base algebra is the field of complex numbers, this class includes the q-Gaussian algebras and free Araki-Woods factors, and for arbitrary base algebras Shlyakhtenko’s von Neumann algebras generated by operator-valued semicircular variables fall into this class. In the case when the base algebra is a type I factor, I will present how a disintegration theory for the underlying Hilbert bimodules leads to a decomposition as a tensor product of the base algebra and a scalar-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebra. Moreover, operator-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebras come with a natural weight, and I will discuss the associated modular theory ass well as some sufficient criteria for factoriality.

Inspired by the Prague Spring, the best friends undertake a quest to find a life different from their previously regimented patriarchal society. Picking up men to fleece for fancy dinners, escaping sexual obligations by hopping trains, chatting up a man on the phone while roasting and cutting sausages in their room, the two are transgressive adventurers and inveterate consumers. They must be seen to be believed: frenzied, obsessive, undaunted until a Boschian ending plunges them into the consequences of their actions. Věra Chytilová made a visionary masterpiece that has always been ahead of its time: feminist for the 1970s, punk performance for the 1980s, postapocalyptic vision for the 1990s, it deserves absolute celebration for its empowering invention of female buddies on the move.",

The title character (played by Klaus Kinski) was himself obsessively driven to build an opera house in the turn-of-the-century Amazon. Stunning footage of the seething jungle and its native inhabitants sets the scene for director Herzog’s four-year struggle to complete his film. To finance his project, Fitzcarraldo moves a riverboat over a mountain between two rivers, which Herzog re-creates for his film, the jungle fighting him every step of the way. Facing a nonstop series of obstacles to his dream—including border wars, the location camp being raided and burned by Indigenous peoples, and the loss of the original star, Jason Robards, after filming was 40 percent complete—Herzog claims, “I’m running out of fantasy,” as birds call loudly in the background. In one of the more unusual films about filmmaking, Les Blank and Maureen Gosling capture a story that has to be seen to be believed.",

   "Description": "In his first film, Marco Bellocchio attempted to break away from traditional analytical and descriptive methods of narration. “The style dictated itself while I was shooting,” he said. “I simply wanted to convey my own love-hate feelings about life as effectively as I could, with no premeditation.” On the film’s presentation at the 1966 San Francisco International Film Festival, Albert Johnson described it as “a deterministic examination of the way in which an adolescent tries to insert himself into the contemporary world. One is introduced to a family of three boys and a girl who live with their blind mother in a villa, outside of an Italian provincial town. The eldest son, Augusto, already has a place in the outside world, a job, and a fiancée. During a weekend visit, he observes Sandro, the adolescent son, restlessly bored with his existence, and struggling with portents of epilepsy and incestuous devotion to Giulia, the sister. Leone, the youngest son, is a hopeless catatonic. Out of the grim material described, the director has created a genuinely moving slice-of-life, for the performances are extremely urgent, impulsive, and alive.”",

In the first moments of dialogue (“Meet me at the house at Palos Verdes”), the setting is revealed to be Los Angeles. Criss Cross is taut, exciting, extremely well-written, and one of the best of the sleazy underworld films of the 1940s, the closest Robert Siodmak came to capturing the essence of Fritz Lang.",

When the base algebra is the field of complex numbers, this class includes the q-Gaussian algebras and free Araki-Woods factors, and for arbitrary base algebras Shlyakhtenko’s von Neumann algebras generated by operator-valued semicircular variables fall into this class. In the case when the base algebra is a type I factor, I will present how a disintegration theory for the underlying Hilbert bimodules leads to a decomposition as a tensor product of the base algebra and a scalar-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebra. Moreover, operator-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebras come with a natural weight, and I will discuss the associated modular theory ass well as some sufficient criteria for factoriality.

Picking up men to fleece for fancy dinners, escaping sexual obligations by hopping trains, chatting up a man on the phone while roasting and cutting sausages in their room, the two are transgressive adventurers and inveterate consumers. They must be seen to be believed: frenzied, obsessive, undaunted until a Boschian ending plunges them into the consequences of their actions. Věra Chytilová made a visionary masterpiece that has always been ahead of its time: feminist for the 1970s, punk performance for the 1980s, postapocalyptic vision for the 1990s, it deserves absolute celebration for its empowering invention of female buddies on the move.",

Stunning footage of the seething jungle and its native inhabitants sets the scene for director Herzog’s four-year struggle to complete his film. To finance his project, Fitzcarraldo moves a riverboat over a mountain between two rivers, which Herzog re-creates for his film, the jungle fighting him every step of the way. Facing a nonstop series of obstacles to his dream—including border wars, the location camp being raided and burned by Indigenous peoples, and the loss of the original star, Jason Robards, after filming was 40 percent complete—Herzog claims, “I’m running out of fantasy,” as birds call loudly in the background.

In the first moments of dialogue (“Meet me at the house at Palos Verdes”), the setting is revealed to be Los Angeles. Criss Cross is taut, exciting, extremely well-written, and one of the best of the sleazy underworld films of the 1940s, the closest Robert Siodmak came to capturing the essence of Fritz Lang.",

When the base algebra is the field of complex numbers, this class includes the q-Gaussian algebras and free Araki-Woods factors, and for arbitrary base algebras Shlyakhtenko’s von Neumann algebras generated by operator-valued semicircular variables fall into this class. In the case when the base algebra is a type I factor, I will present how a disintegration theory for the underlying Hilbert bimodules leads to a decomposition as a tensor product of the base algebra and a scalar-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebra. Moreover, operator-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebras come with a natural weight, and I will discuss the associated modular theory ass well as some sufficient criteria for factoriality.

Inspired by the Prague Spring, the best friends undertake a quest to find a life different from their previously regimented patriarchal society. Picking up men to fleece for fancy dinners, escaping sexual obligations by hopping trains, chatting up a man on the phone while roasting and cutting sausages in their room, the two are transgressive adventurers and inveterate consumers. They must be seen to be believed: frenzied, obsessive, undaunted until a Boschian ending plunges them into the consequences of their actions. Věra Chytilová made a visionary masterpiece that has always been ahead of its time: feminist for the 1970s, punk performance for the 1980s, postapocalyptic vision for the 1990s, it deserves absolute celebration for its empowering invention of female buddies on the move.",

The title character (played by Klaus Kinski) was himself obsessively driven to build an opera house in the turn-of-the-century Amazon. Stunning footage of the seething jungle and its native inhabitants sets the scene for director Herzog’s four-year struggle to complete his film. To finance his project, Fitzcarraldo moves a riverboat over a mountain between two rivers, which Herzog re-creates for his film, the jungle fighting him every step of the way. Facing a nonstop series of obstacles to his dream—including border wars, the location camp being raided and burned by Indigenous peoples, and the loss of the original star, Jason Robards, after filming was 40 percent complete—Herzog claims, “I’m running out of fantasy,” as birds call loudly in the background. In one of the more unusual films about filmmaking, Les Blank and Maureen Gosling capture a story that has to be seen to be believed.",

One is introduced to a family of three boys and a girl who live with their blind mother in a villa, outside of an Italian provincial town. The eldest son, Augusto, already has a place in the outside world, a job, and a fiancée. During a weekend visit, he observes Sandro, the adolescent son, restlessly bored with his existence, and struggling with portents of epilepsy and incestuous devotion to Giulia, the sister. Leone, the youngest son, is a hopeless catatonic. Out of the grim material described, the director has created a genuinely moving slice-of-life, for the performances are extremely urgent, impulsive, and alive.”",

   "Description": "This first “spaghetti” Western was a sagebrush version of Akira Kurosawa’s Yojimbo, with lanky Clint Eastwood as The Man with No Name, an itinerant gunslinger who finds himself in a beat-up border town ruled over by two ruthless clans. Dressed in the poncho and dusty Stetson that would be his well-worn wardrobe through two sequels, the nameless one plays one clan off the other in a bit of inspired treachery. His very arch nemesis is Gian Maria Volontè as Ramón Rojo, the smarter of two felonious brothers. Unlike his brutish bro’, Volontè plays it with a harrowing hair trigger, the coming violence seemingly pooled in his piercing eyes. Like Eastwood’s flinty character, the border town is nameless, an unruly frontier where six-gun alliances evaporate swiftly in the delirious sun. Ennio Morricone’s bravura mix of surf guitar, gongs, and rustic choir only adds to the delirium of this virtuosic oater filled with tumbleweed nihilism.",

   "Description": "Over the last couple of years, it has become evident that matrix-valued semicircular elements establish strong links between free probability theory and noncommutative algebra. Another surprising connection of this kind was found in a recently finished project with Roland Speicher. We have shown that the Fuglede-Kadison determinant of an arbitrary matrix-valued semicircular element is essentially given by the capacity of its associated covariance map. In addition, we have improved a lower bound by Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira and Widgerson on this capacity, by making it dimension-independent. In my talk, I will present these results, explaining also their relevance in the context of the authors’ joint work with Johannes Hoffmann on the noncommutative Edmonds’ problem.",

Eli Wallach (the “ugly,” absolutely), Lee Van Cleef (the “bad,” undoubtedly), and Eastwood (the “good,” barely) crisscross the arid Texas plains while double-crossing one another as they search for a fortune in stolen Confederate gold. It’s not the story that one remembers, however, but how it’s told—or painted, as the film’s innovative opening credits suggest. Like a brush on canvas, Sergio Leone’s lens colors desolation with beauty, juxtaposing close-ups of scarred faces with long-distance shots of sky-stretched panoramas to create a disorienting, almost hyperreal landscape, one aurally haunted by Ennio Morricone’s now-legendary score. Here the American hunt for gold winds up—literally—in the grave.",

(Tellingly, her main success is in forming a cooperative.) Not surprisingly for a wartime film, social obligation and female self-sacrifice are celebrated, though as ambiguously, and tragically, as the times would allow. “Notes insists on social obligation as potentially liberating,” wrote critic Chris Fujiwara. “This insistence would appear to be less conservative than anarchistic.”",

From the opening sequence—a desperate ride through nowhere shot in glistening blacks and not much white—Aldrich and cinematographer Ernest Laszlo evoke a world that is not quite recognizable yet is frighteningly familiar. It is Los Angeles. Tackiness here is palpable, from the shabby-sturdy streets of Bunker Hill to the more vulnerable Laurel Canyon. And forget Malibu; it’s gone, man. The sincerely deadpan acting of Ralph Meeker as Mickey Spillane’s Mike Hammer offers a nihilistic antihero whose mediocrity is well met by the company he keeps. (The one sensitive character in the film is institutionalized.) In a plot played out in paranoid glances and unanswered questions, at once comic-book naive and amazingly cynical, the search is not for jewels or statuettes or even drugs, but for a lead-lined box containing a small atomic bomb. Mere greed is a thing of the past. Welcome to Alphaville.",

A Quiet Place in the Country scrapes a key across the high-gloss, pop aesthetic of Italy’s postwar economic miracle to reveal the undertow of the country’s unresolved fascist past.",

His cohorts include a colorless little cashier prodded by his wife’s demands for dough, a reformed drunk, a racketeering cop, and the track bartender. The action is taut as it follows each man’s role up to the point of the heist, and the film loses no acuity in its exploration of the domestic lives and personal motives of the criminals. Kubrick’s direction of his own script is fast-paced and incisive, at times almost documentary, and Lucien Ballard’s excellent photography is augmented by well-chosen stock racetrack footage.",

As applications of our result, we will show that the set of reducible operators in a separable properly infinite factor is operator norm dense and that Voiculescu’s bi-commutant theorem holds in certain coronal algebras.",

Trolling the grounds and sky above is an overfamiliar, pestering gray heron who leads Mahito deep into a realm of hallucinatory, time-bending fantasy, where he confronts a magical fisherwoman, blobby spirits called warawara, a parakeet army, and his own past and future.",

Against the poetic background of the four seasons, the boys deal with their father’s death, are forced to find work, and weather it all with their inherent optimism. For critic John Gillett, Four Seasons “is an expressive fusion of all Shimizu’s thematic and stylistic preoccupations: distant shooting of figures placed in a living, open-air landscape, a loving regard for children, and a traveling camera which always reveals. The passage of time is conveyed in sequences of limpid, lyrical impressionism which look forward to early Satyajit Ray.”",

   "Description": "Where the Dollars trilogy was about the lethal lengths to which one might go to get a fistful, this saga draws a bead on the taming of the once-wild West as an industrial enterprise. Here the railroad cuts across the virgin landscape on the iron tracks of progress, powered not by steam but by the dark coal of capital. Cast against type, Henry Fonda, his blue eyes cooled to evil azure, does the bidding of a railway tycoon (Gabriele Ferzetti) driven by his own loco motives. Derailing the plans of big money is Claudia Cardinale as a frontier widow fighting for her spread, aided by two high plains drifters, Cheyenne (Jason Robards), an old-school outlaw, and Harmonica (Charles Bronson), an avenging angel with a devil’s quick draw. All of Sergio Leone’s punch-drunk particulars are here: the epic close-ups of weathered faces, Ennio Morricone’s telegraphic score, and smokin’ shoot-outs set against majestic vistas. This time, though, Leone brings his revisions right to Monument Valley, putting the whole Western genre squarely in his sights.",

   "Description": "This UC Berkeley Library exhibit explores the themes of the documentary Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution, which is the featured work of this year’s On the Same Page program. The film traces the genesis of the Disability Rights Movement from Camp Jened, a camp for teenagers with disabilities in upstate New York, to UC Berkeley, and then to San Francisco for the 504 sit-in, the longest sit-in at a federal building to date. This fascinating story is richly illustrated by primary sources from Library collections, including photographs, memoirs, oral histories, newsletters, and publications by allies such as the Black Panthers.",

   "Description": "The film opens with an aerial nighttime view of a metropolis, but the camera soon draws its circle around three figures acting out an obsessive “criss cross” of love and betrayal: Burt Lancaster, a would-be petty crook; Dan Duryea, as always, hiding cruelty behind his baby face; and Yvonne De Carlo, wed, in her way, to both. In the first moments of dialogue (“Meet me at the house at Palos Verdes”), the setting is revealed to be Los Angeles. Criss Cross is taut, exciting, extremely well-written, and one of the best of the sleazy underworld films of the 1940s, the closest Robert Siodmak came to capturing the essence of Fritz Lang.",
